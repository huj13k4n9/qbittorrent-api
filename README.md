# qbittorrent-api

A Golang wrapper for qBittorrent Web API (for qBittorrent â‰¥ v4.1), inspired by [go-qbittorrent](https://github.com/superturkey650/go-qbittorrent).

This wrapper is fully based on the specifications on the official qBitTorrent wiki: <https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/WebUI-API-(qBittorrent-4.1)>

It'll be best if you upgrade your client to the latest version.
